# LetMotiv
LetMotiv is a project aiming at helping students to find their path. We give high schoolers and middle schoolers all the necessary tools to know themselves better and discover themselves a little bit more everyday.
For that purpose, we are developping an app that challenges the kid on activities to organize and/or participate in with his schoolmates. 
Then, a chatbot in the app will help him understand and reflect on what he learned, liked, disliked and got interested in, through a casual discussion.

This project is made possible by the Fondation Mines-Télécom with their open-innovation program, the program FIRST. --> https://programmefirst.agorize.com/fr/challenges/programmefirst
